Thank you for your interest in Sargent! Sargent is a normalization-free,
cluster-free, and single cell-based annotation algorithm for rapidly identifying
the cell-types of origin based on sets of cell type-specific marker genes. This
vignette gives an overview and introduction to Sargent’s functionality.

# Installation

Sargent can be installed from github:

```{r install-sargent, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("Sanofi-Public/PMCB-Sargent", 
                         build_vignettes=FALSE)
```

# Setup

To run the examples in this tutorial, you will need to install the `Seurat`,
`ggplot2`, and `dplyr` packages. Once all installed, they can be loaded with the
following commands:

```{r require libraries, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(sargent)
```

A small example database, `sargentDemoData`, is included in the `sargent`
package. This database contains a small subset of 100 cells from human kidney
from Tabula Sapiens Consortium [@tabula2022tabula], manually annotated by
experts. This database contains multiple items, but for the sake of this
tutorial we will only need the gene expression matrix (`gex`) and associated
meta-data (`mt.data`). The expression matrix is from a single-cell RNA-seq
dataset and is formatted with genes as rows and cells as columns.  We extract
the relevant information for this demo using the following commands:

```{r load-data, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Access gene expression
gex <- get(data("sargentDemoData"))$gex
print(dim(gex))
print(gex[1:10,1:10])

# Access meta data
mt.data <- get(data("sargentDemoData"))$mt.data
print(dim(mt.data))
print(head(mt.data))
```

There are three columns in `mt.data`: 1) `organ_tissue` contains organ tissue
information, 2) `free_annotation` contains experts’ annotation, and 3)
`celltype` contains abbreviations for cell-type compartments, e.g. `B` for B
cells, `MPh` for Myeloid-lineage cells, `TNK` for T and Natural killer cells,
`Endo` for Endothelial, and `Epit` for Epithelial:

```{r abbriv-table, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(table(mt.data$free_annotation, mt.data$celltype))
```

The `TNK` is a curated group, for the sake of this tutorial, to combine
cell-types of similar phenotypes (e.g., T and Natural killer cells). In Section
4 of this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to split this group back into their
original sub-types.

The other input required for annotation is annotating recipe: a list of
gene-sets to explore on the cells. This is the fundamental building block of
`sargent` and an important information for an accurate outcome. Therefore,
investigators should have a broad understanding of cells and corresponding
markers they expect to observe in the tissue under investigation. In this demo,
for instance, we are exploring cells from Kidney, so one would expect to
discover Immune, Endothelial, and Epithelial cell-types. Cell-type signatures
should be provided in a vector format stored in a list:

```{r build-gene-set, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gene.sets <- list("Endo" = c("TGFBR2", "NOTCH4", "ADGRL4", "EMCN", "ENG", 
                             "PECAM1", "PLVAP", "TEK", "KDR", "EPCAM", 
                             "GJA5", "CDH5", "SEMA3G", "PTPRB", "SLC14A1"), 
                  "Epit" = c("ANPEP", "AQP1", "SLC13A3", "SLC16A9", "SLC17A3", 
                             "SLC22A7", "SLC22A8"),
                  "TNK" = c("CD4", "CD3D", "CD3E", "CD3G", "IL7R", "CD8A", 
                            "CD8B", "FOXP3", "TIGIT", "CD27", "NCAM1", "KLRF1", 
                            "GNLY", "NKG7", "TNFRSF18"),
                  "B" = c("CD79A", "CD79B", "MS4A1", "CD19", "JCHAIN"),
                  "MPh" = c("CD4", "MS4A7", "VCAN", "CD14", "FCN1", "LYZ", 
                            "FCGR3A", "ITGAM", "MARCO", "CD1C", "ITGAX"))
```

Annotation in `sargent` is performed in three sequential steps:

**Scoring**: `sargent` uses a score-based procedure to infer the cell-type of
origin for each cell among given gene-sets. This procedure transforms an input
gene-by-cell expression matrix into a corresponding gene-set-by-cell assignment
score matrix. Then, each individual cell is labeled with the cell-type with the
highest assignment score.

**Trimming**: `sargent` uses a measure of dispersion, gini-index, to identify
ambiguous calls. First, it calculates a gini-index among assignment scores per
cell, transforming the gene-set-by-cell assignment score matrix to a
distribution of indexes. Then, two conditions are evaluated. First, whether the
gini-index is more than `gini.sigma` (adjustable) below the mean of
distribution. The default `gini.sigma` is equal to 3 and is motivated by the
fact that for a normal distribution, 99.7% of  observations lie within three
standard deviations of the mean. Smaller values for `gini.sigma` will increase
the stringency in confidence of assignments. Second, whether the gini-index is
less than `gini.min` (adjustable). Statistically, a gini index below 0.5
(default) does not represent a severe dispersion, suggesting a poor annotation.
Such ambiguous calls remain unclassified and are relabeled as `unclassified`s.

**Smoothing**: One last step is k-nearest neighbor smoothing (optional input).
This step is designed to smoothen annotations by aggregating information from
cells with similar genome-wide expression profiles (neighbors). Smoothing is
performed by first identifying cells with a minimum of `n.neighbors`
nearest-neighbors (default is 10). Then, if more than 50% of neighbors reach a
consensus on their labels, the surrounded cell will be relabeled according to
the neighbors' verdict. Investigators can build such matrix using standard
`Seurat` pipeline with the following commands:

```{r make-adjacent, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
adjacent.mtx <- attr(CreateSeuratObject(counts=gex) %>%
                         NormalizeData(., normalization.method="LogNormalize", 
                                       scale.factor=1e6, verbose=FALSE) %>%
                         FindVariableFeatures(., selection.method="vst", 
                                              nfeatures=2000, verbose=FALSE) %>%
                         ScaleData(., do.scale=TRUE, do.center=TRUE, 
                                   verbose=FALSE) %>%
                         RunPCA(., features=VariableFeatures(.), 
                                verbose=FALSE) %>%
                         FindNeighbors(., reduction="pca", dims=1:30, 
                                       k.param=20, verbose=FALSE), 
                     which="graphs")[["RNA_nn"]]
print(dim(adjacent.mtx))
print(adjacent.mtx[1:10,1:10])
```

# Annotation and Diagnosis

After we have selected the dataset we wish to annotate, defined our gene set
marker lists (and build the optional k-nearest neighbor matrix), we pass all of
the information as inputs into the `sargentAnnotation` function to infer
cell-types:

```{r annotate-all, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
srgnt <- sargentAnnotation(gex=gex,
                           gene.sets=gene.sets,
                           adjacent.mtx=adjacent.mtx)
```

This function will produce the inferred cell types from the data provided and
output the results in a  `sargentObject`. A summary of annotations can be seen
with a print command:

```{r print-summary, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(srgnt)
```

We can compare our inferred annotation against the experts’ original annotation
in a table:

```{r compare, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
table(predicted=fetchAssignment(srgnt), truth=mt.data$celltype)
```

`sargent` contains a set of stand-alone functions to investigate the
performance of its annotation algorithm. For instance, we use `fetchDensityPlot`
function to visualize the distribution of dispersion measures. Below we can see
that assignments have high gini-index (a gini-index above 0.5 represents severe
dispersion among cell-types assignment-scores), suggesting a trustworthy
annotation:

```{r dispersion measures, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=5}
fetchDensityPlot(srgnt)
```
The red vertical dashed-line marks the lower-leg of the `gini.sigma` of the
distribution (mean-3*SD). The black vertical dashed-line marks the `gini.min`.

To explore the expression of genes that were used in annotation, we pass the
`srgnt` object to `fetchDotPlot` function with the following command:

```{r fetchDotPlot-1, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4.0, fig.width=10}
fetchDotPlot(srgnt, min.pct=0.1) + 
  theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=17),
        legend.title=element_text(size=14),
          legend.text=element_text(size=13)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Endo", "Epit", "TNK", "B", "MPh"))
```

Instead of making a dot-plot, we can directly explore the annotation outcomes.
Sargent object includes a `data.frame` which contains a summary of outcomes for
given cell-types and gene markers in the following columns: 

  * `cell_count`: number of cells per cell-type,
  * `cell_exp_count`: number of cells that express a given gene, 
  * `pct_exp`: fraction of cells that express a given gene,
  * `mean_exp`: average expression, 
  * `z_score`: z-score calculated across given cell-types.
  
This summary is accessible with the following command:

```{r celltype-summary-1, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=5.0}
# gene expression summary for each marker
print(head(srgnt@celltype_summary, 6))
```

# Sub-annotation

A prudent strategy to annotate single-cell RNA-seq data is to annotate cells
according to the hierarchy of known cell-types. In Sections 2 of this demo, we
first annotated T and Natural Killer cells into one group, `TNK`. In this
section, we continue sub-annotating until we achieve our desired granularity.

`fetchCell` function allows us to extract cell-ids assigned to a specific
cell-type, (e.g. the `TNK` cell-type):


```{r fetch-cells, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# get cells annotated as T or Natural Killer cells (TNKs)
cells <- fetchCell(srgnt, cell.types="TNK")$cell
print(cells[1:5])
```

Next, we build a new recipe to distinguish T cells from Natural Killer cells,
followed by construction of a nearest-neighbor graph for the `TNK`
subpopulation:

```{r negative-markers, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# list of gene markers
gene.sets.tnk <- list("T" = c("CD4", "CD3D", "CD3E", "CD3G", "IL7R", "CD8A", "CD8B", "FOXP3", "TIGIT",
                              "CD27", "NKG7", "GNLY"),
                      "NK" = c("KLRF1", "KLRC1", "KLRC2", "NCAM1", "FGFBP2", "FCGR3A", "CX3CR1", 
                               "NCR1", "FCER1G", "KDELC1", "NKG7", "GNLY", "KLRD1", "CD7"))

# Nearest-neighbor graph construction
adj.mtx.tnk <- attr(CreateSeuratObject(counts=gex) %>%
                      subset(., cell=cells) %>%
                      NormalizeData(., normalization.method="LogNormalize", scale.factor=1e6, verbose=FALSE) %>%
                      FindVariableFeatures(., selection.method="vst", nfeatures=2000, verbose=FALSE) %>%
                      ScaleData(., do.scale=TRUE, do.center=TRUE, verbose=FALSE) %>%
                      RunPCA(., features=VariableFeatures(.), npcs=15, verbose=FALSE) %>%
                      FindNeighbors(., reduction="pca", dims=1:15, k.param=5, verbose=FALSE), 
                    which="graphs")[["RNA_nn"]]

```

An additional functionality of `sargent` is its ability to incorporate lowly
expressed signatures. By default, the signature genes are expected to be highly
expressed in one particular cell-type compared to all other cell-types. However,
genes that are characteristically lowly expressed in one cell-type compared to
the other cell-types can also be used as signatures. For example, the lack of
expression of 'IL7R', 'CD3D', and 'CD8A' in Natural Killer cells can be utilized
as a part of their signature. This functionality helps to increase dispersion in
assignment scores among cell-types with similar expression profiles.
Investigators can use `gene.sets.neg` argument in `sargentAnnotation` function
to introduce lowly expressed signatures:

```{r annotate-tnk, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=6}
# annotate TNK subset  
 srgnt_tnk <- sargentAnnotation(gex=gex, 
                                cells=cells,
                                gene.sets=gene.sets.tnk,
                                gene.sets.neg = list("T" = c("KLRF1", "KLRC1"),
                                                     "NK" = c("IL7R", "CD3D", "CD8A")),
                                adjacent.mtx=adj.mtx.tnk)
 print(srgnt_tnk)
```

The expression of selected signatures can also be explored with the
`fetchDotPlot` function:

```{r fetchDotPlot-2, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5.5}
genes <- c("CD3D", "CD3E", "CD8A", "CD4","IL7R",
           "NKG7", "GNLY", "FGFBP2", "FCGR3A", "FCER1G")
fetchDotPlot(srgnt_tnk, genes=genes) + 
    theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=13),
          legend.key.height=grid::unit(8, "points"), 
          legend.key.width=grid::unit(10, "points"),
          legend.spacing=grid::unit(7, "points"))
```

# Novel Cell-type Discovery

`sargent` can also be used to discover novel cell-types. For example, in this
demo, we seek to identify regulatory cells among annotated T cells. Again, the
first step is to develop a recipe of signature genes. Then, `sargent` calculates
assignment scores according to the gene-set. The assignment score distribution
tends to be bi-modal, where the lower mode represents cells with low expression
of signature genes (`unclassified`s) and the higher mode represents those with high
expression of signature genes (`REG`s in this scenario). Therefore, a reasonable
choice of score threshold is one that separates these two modes. Investigators
can use `only.score` argument from `sargentAnnotation` to first visualize the
distribution of assignment scores:

```{r find-threshold, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=5.0}

# get cells annotated as T cells
cells <- fetchCell(srgnt_tnk, cell.types="T")$cell

# regulatory gene signitures
gene_sets_treg <- list("REG" = c("FOXP3", "TIGIT",  "CTLA4",
                                 "IL2RA", "TNFRSF9", "IKZF2"))

# calculate assignment scores
srgnt_scr <- sargentAnnotation(gex=gex, cells=cells,
                               gene.sets=gene_sets_treg, only.score=TRUE)

# visulaize score distribution
fetchDensityPlot(srgnt_scr)
```

For this scenario, a threshold of 0.2 is able to cleanly separate the two modes
of the distribution. The `score.threshold` argument from `sargentAnnotation` is
available to apply this threshold with the following command:

```{r annotate-treg, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=5.0}
# annotate cells
srgnt_treg <- sargentAnnotation(gex=gex, cells=cells,
                                gene.sets=gene_sets_treg, score.threshold=0.2)

# print outcome
print(srgnt_treg)
```

A summary of annotation outcomes is accessible with the following command:

```{r celltype-summary-2, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=5.0}
# gene expression summary for each marker
print(head(srgnt_treg@celltype_summary, 12))
```

Another functionality of `sargent` that we use in this training is
`fetchMergeSargents`. This function combines multiple `sargentObject`s into one
`data.frame` based on the given cell ids. If a cell id appears in multiple
objects, it will separate its labels by `.`. This function is useful when
investigators intend to follow a hierarchical annotation workflow:

```{r merge-srgnts, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=5.0}
print(srgnt)

print(srgnt_tnk)

print(srgnt_treg)

# merge three sargent objects to one data.frame
srgnt_all <- fetchMergeSargents(srgnt, srgnt_tnk, srgnt_treg)
print(head(srgnt_all, 10))

print(table(srgnt_all$celltype))
```

# FAQs

*Can gene signatures be shared across multiple cell-types?*

Yes, gene signatures can be shared across multiple cell-types. However, the
elements of annotating recipe should be decisive enough (i.e., include markers
unique to a specific cell-type) to guide `sargent` to accurately distinguish
cell-types.

*What is the best strategy to achieve an accurate annotation?*

A prudent strategy to improve annotation accuracy is to build a hierarchy of
known cell-types and perform sub-annotation in each level, until the desired
granularity is achieved.
