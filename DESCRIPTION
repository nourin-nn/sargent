Title: Single Cell Annotation
Description: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments provide 
    opportunities to peer into the complex tissues at single-cell resolution. 
    However, accurate biological interpretation of scRNA-seq data is contingent 
    on accurate annotation of cell-types. Sargent performs a normalize-free and 
    cluster-free algorithm for rapidly identifying the cell-types of origin 
    based on cell type-specific gene-markers. Sargent contains several functions 
    for standalone pipeline analyses and workflow development.
